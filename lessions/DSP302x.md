## Defining Data Analytic (Input - Output - For which question?)
  1. Descriptive Analytic
    - Input: Historical/Past Data
    - Output: Describe and explain findings to stakeholder. Insight (past)
    - For: What happened?

  2. Diagnostic Analytic
    - Input: Insight from Descriptive Analysis and find the cause of the outcome
    - Output: Cause
    - For: Why did it happen?

  3. Predictive Analytic
    - Input: Historical data and trend
    - Output: Outcome, (risk assessment and forecast). Must be probabilistic in nature
    - For: What will happen?

  4. Prescriptive Analytic
    - Input: Historical data, Predictive models
    - Output: Recommendation for action
    - How can we make it happen?

## Data Analysis
1. Settings a clear metric
2. Gathering data
3. Cleaning data
4. Analyzing and Mining data
  - Identifying trend, correlations, patterns and variations
5. Interpreting results
  - Evaluate if analysis can be convincing, and mention limitations/uncertainty
6. Present findings
  - by both words and visualization 

## What is Data Analytic / Data analysis
- In summary, data analysis refers specifically to the process of examining and interpreting data to derive insights, while data analytics encompasses the broader range of activities involved in collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to inform decision-making. Data analysis is a subset of data analytics.
- Analysis can be view as historical data analysis, and data analytics can be refered as derive future outcome ...
